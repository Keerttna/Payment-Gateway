# Project Abstract: Payment Gateway Using Java with MySQL and JDBC Connectivity

The "Payment Gateway" is a comprehensive and user-friendly software application developed using Java, with the Front-end (GUI) implemented through Java Swing, and MySQL and JDBC for seamless database connectivity. This project aims to provide a secure and efficient platform for managing banking transactions and account operations. It encompasses two primary databases: the Bank database, which stores user information, and the User database, which maintains account-specific details including account type, balance, and interest rates.

## Key Functionalities:

1. User Account Creation and Password Generation: The system enables users to create new accounts by entering their personal information. A unique and secure password is generated automatically for each user, ensuring data confidentiality.

2. User Authentication: Existing users can log in securely by verifying their credentials. The system ensures that only authorized users gain access to their accounts and perform transactions.

3. Account Management: Users can open both Savings and Fixed Deposit accounts, providing them with flexible options to manage their finances. Account details such as account type, balance and transaction types are stored in the User database.

4. Money Deposit and Withdrawal: The system allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts, effectively updating the account balances in the database. This feature ensures that users can conveniently manage their money.

5. Fund Transfer: Users can transfer funds between accounts within the same bank, provided both the sender and receiver have accounts in the bank. This functionality simplifies transactions between users and supports seamless money transfers.

6. Check Balance: Users can inquire about their account balances at any time, ensuring transparency and convenience in monitoring their financial status.

7. Transaction History: The system maintains a detailed transaction history of the present month for each user, providing a comprehensive record of all account-related activities. Users can review their transaction history to track their financial transactions.

The Payment Gateway offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for individuals to manage their banking needs. By utilizing Java with Java Swing for the front-end GUI, MySQL for robust database management, and JDBC for database connectivity, the system ensures data accuracy, security, and reliability. The project's primary goal is to simplify banking operations for users while providing administrators with effective tools to manage user accounts.
